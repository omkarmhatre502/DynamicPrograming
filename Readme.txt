1) Grid-Problem
   Say that you are travel on 2D grid. Yo begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel
   to the bottom right corner. You may only move down or right.
   In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a 2D grid with dimension m*n
   (1,1) =1    (2,3) = 3  (3,2) = 3  (3,3) = 6
   (18,18) = 2333606220
